## What is The RoomApp?

### The RoomApp lets you book private spaces On-Demand, by the hour.

These spaces are rooms in residential houses for maximum availability, convenience, affordability, and scalability.

They are furnished like library study spaces/ office spaces, ranging from a casual setting all the way to a conference room- like setting to tailor to a variety of the user needs and demands. We will also include a list of additional amenities (printer, whiteboard, TV, projector, stationary, etc. which all vary by the type of space) to make sure there are plenty of resources in order to get work done.

### Make workspace availability flexible aound your schedule, not the other way round.


### What problem am I trying to solve? [Make this a link]
Here's the problem I noticed in my college. I have heard from people about my college library having almost no spots available during exam seasons like midterms and finals weeks. I also decided to go survey the library for a couple of days during final exams week to see the availability of space, and here are the results:

For those who do not/ have not gone to ucsd, Each floor represents a different type of study environment. In the first two floors, normal talking and discussion is allowed. Floors 4- 7 allow whispering but overall should quiet. The eighth floor, talking is not allowed at all and should be completely quiet.

As you can see from the pictures above, you can see that floors 1, 2, and 8 are usually the busiest. Based on the type of study environment, my hypothesis is that students like to have active discussion with each other. They also like studying in the 8th floor because there would be no disturbance and has a better ambience compared to other floors.

Based on my observations, I have come up with a few hypotheses: 
- Students like to have active discussions when studying/ working
- They would like having a quiet environment
- They would prefer having a good room ambience when doing work

In order to have all these, reserving study rooms seems like the best option. Except, these reservations get filled up even faster on average.

This is a snapshot I took of the study room reservations webpage on a normal day at 4:00 pm (when there are no exams or major projects due):






### What are my customer pain points? [Make this a link]


### What are my customer gains? [Make this a link]



#### Benefits of using this service
- An alternative to coffee shops
    1. More privacy, more quiet environment, more amenities  
    2. A more professional setting for some events that need to be scheduled last minute/ within a short period of time. For example, off- campus interviews, presentations.

- More flexible than a Library Study Space
    1. 24/7 availability *(you can find a room round the clock)*, so the timings will be flexible around your schedule   
    2. Reserve a room for hours on end, starting from your preferred time. *(Anywhere from an hour to the entire day. Library study spaces usually have a 2- 3 hour cap, not guaranteed that you can renew the space. Also, it is not guaranteed that library study spaces are always available until you call the desk, or personally go find out the availability)*   
    3. Libraries usually require that you are a resident or a student to book an individual study space. This service lets you reserve a space anytime, on demand, as long as you are a verified user.   
    
- A lot more choice for what room to reserve
    1. You can choose what amenities you would need and the type of workspace that would be the most helpful to you.

- General
   1. Reserve a room starting from one hour all the way until the next reserved time.

#### How this service could be used by customers
- Work on group projects
- In- person group meetings/ conferences
- Off campus interviews for companies, projects, etc., but need a more professional setting than a coffee shop and require
- Need more amenities than what a library offers (This could vary based on the room)
- Location- wise: need to wait nearby a specific place but going home is too far away
- *(Maybe)* Region- specific areas: Bad weather (strong winds, heavy rains, thunderstorms, heat waves, etc.), and need shelter for a couple of hours.

#### Why I'm using residential homes instead of commercially owned buildings like WeWork or Regus
- Less capital to start off with in the beginning (No huge buildings are required to lease or buy, just security equipment for homes and making sure everything runs smoothly for hosts)
- Less maintenance costs property taxes, etc. because of no commercial building rentals, so the room costs would be significantly cheaper for users
- Easier to scale when there is an increase in demand from customers
- Creates jobs for Gig workers as an extra source of income
- Residential neighborhoods are spread across the city, so there won't be a problem searching for one nearby (Worst case scenario ~ 8-10 mile radius) ANYWHERE with in the city and its outskirts.


##### What I want to do in the future [Make this a link]
- A place to take rest or a break, but going home is too far away (Diversify the ways in which the rooms are furnished)
- A place to take a shower (An extra feature that costs extra)
- Need to freshen up
- Use rooms as partial/ complete storage facilities for companies like Amazon to reduce delivery time and costs

##### Future Customers
- Commuters
- Sports fans, 
   1. Baseball (Major event: 2022)
   2. Football (Major events: Superbowl, every year)
   3. **2028 LA Olympics** - The Jackpot
